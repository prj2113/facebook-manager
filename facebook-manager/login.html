	<p> Have you ever found Facebook news feeds difficult to manage? When you want to search for a particular status update that your friend has posted or a link of an article somebody shared that you liked and now after a few hours when you go back to check it you don’t see it anymore? This can become a bit annoying and a complete waste of time when you have to search through to all those new feeds looking for it. This is when FACEBOOK MANAGER comes into the picture. Basically our application provides a systematic segregation of the user’s news feeds. The status updates that are posted by the user’s friends, the photos that they have uploaded, the various links to articles videos or images that they have shared and the places that they have checked into are all systematically segregated and displayed.  Facebook Manager makes it easy to search and manage the latest updates that the user has. It also provides hyperlink to the actual post on fb incase a user wants to a detailed view of a particular post</p>
